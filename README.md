## ChatWith

ChatWith is a web application that allows users to ask questions to historical figures or famous people and receive responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. Users can input the name of the person they want to chat with and a message, and ChatWith will generate a response as if the person was actually responding.

The application uses React as the frontend framework and Axios to send requests to the OpenAI API. Custom fonts from Google Fonts are also used to enhance the visual design of the application.

ChatWith is a fun and educational tool that can provide users with an engaging way to learn more about history and culture. Whether you want to ask Albert Einstein about his theory of relativity or have a chat with Marie Curie about her scientific discoveries, ChatWith can help bring these historical figures to life.
